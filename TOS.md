- Moderators, administrators, the owner of the guild, or more specifically users that can manage messages/have the MESSAGE_MANAGE permission in the guild, are responsible for controlling DJ permissions to moderate other users.<br>I am not liable for this in any way as the necessary tools are provided.

## 6. Termination and Discontinuation

## 10. Updates and Notification
- Users will be notified of changes to the Terms of Service through the Discord server and GitHub repository. Continued use implies acceptance.

## 11. Dispute Resolution
- Disputes between users or with the project owner will be handled through Discord and GitHub communication.
